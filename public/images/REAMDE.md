# Marker Icons

This directory should contain the default Leaflet marker icons:

- marker-icon.png
- marker-icon-2x.png
- marker-shadow.png

You can download these files from the Leaflet distribution:
https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/tree/master/dist/images

These files are necessary for the custom markers to work properly in the Next.js environment.
